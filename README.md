# farmOS Seed Asset Extended

This module is an add-on for the [farmOS](http://drupal.org/project/farm)
distribution.

## Features

Provides additional fields to Seed Assets:
- packed_for_year
- purchase_date
- seed_cost
- seed_weight

Also provides a Custom CSV Importer.  However, the Default CSV Importers will automagically recognize any new bundleFieldDefinition, so use of the Custom CSV Importer is not necessary.
